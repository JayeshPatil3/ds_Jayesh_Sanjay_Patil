## Setup and Execution
Steps followed throughout the project

### Google Colab Notebook

All data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization code is contained within the notebook\_1.ipynb file.

**Google Colab Link:**[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1u2vj0IOreGYvCJcqFhrYrZhMS3H8UFf_?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1u2vj0IOreGYvCJcqFhrYrZhMS3H8UFf_?usp=sharing)

### Data Sources and Methodology

Datasets: Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset (Fear \& Greed Index) and Historical Trader Data from Hyperliquid.

Methodology Highlights: The analysis involved date standardization, PnL volatility as a risk proxy, Lagged Sentiment Analysis (T-1), and Account Segmentation to isolate 'Smart Money' behavior.

---

### Key Findings and Recommendations

The final analysis confirms that profitability is maximized by operating as a contrarian: SELL trades during Greed yield the highest average PnL in the dataset.

The mention leverage column is missing from the dataset which is restricting the further analysis

## Visuals

The visuals generated for analysis are, 

### Heatmap
![Heatmap](Outputs/Heatmap.jpg)

| Visual Output | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
|**Heatmap**| Corerelation of 0.035295 between Volume (Size tokens) and Sentiment (Value) implies that there is an weak positive Correlation between variables implying very less effect of sentiment on the volume.|
|   |Corerelation of 0.011132 between PnL and Sentiment (Value) implies that there is too weak positive correlation between variables,Profitability is not linearly tied to Fear and greed.|

### Average Profit by sentiment graph
